# LinuxCourse
##Introduction
Most high-throughput bioinformatics tasks these days take place on the Unix environment and the most important software are designed to work best when used with a command-line interface. Because the command line can be an intimidating environment, many biologists tends to avoid it and limit their work on available web-based tools or local installation of software with graphic user interface. This means that they miss out the opportunity to access e.g. cloud computing or advance supercomputing which might help them to perform much more interesting analyses. 
The best way to learn how to work in Unix command line environment is to be challenged in real problems trying to resolve them using “Trial and error” method through a self-learning process. Indeed, the Unix users form a very large community and the majority of the solutions are already available online in the web. This course is, therefore, designed to stimulate self and pear-learning using a set of very well designed and realistic bioinformatics problems typically occurring in the life of a biologist. The student will have access to 15 problems posted in a dedicated github account and one month to resolve them. 
##Target group
This course is targeted at PhD and MSc students who are interested in learn how to work in Unix command line environment. NB! This course is mandatory for whom is willing to attend to the course "From microbial genomics to metagenomics" held in December 2017. 
##Learning outcomes
By the end of the course students will have the confidence to navigate throughout the Unix command line environment and to find online solutions for handling basic bioinformatics problems. 
##Schedule
The course will start the 5th of September with a 2 hours introduction and some tips on how to tackle the problems. During the introduction students will learn how to access CSC supercomputing clusters through the command line and how to perform locally a blast job (two requisites for the course). The student will work alone or in groups (if they wish) for the next month to try to resolve the problems. During 18th of September a tutorial session is organized for 2 hours during which students might have the opportunity to ask the teacher for help on how to address the problems. 
- 5th of September 2017	Introduction 	Optional (recommended) 
- 18th of September 2017	Tutorial	Optional
- 5th of October 2017	Submission of the exams to the teachers	Mandatory
- 13th of October 2017	Feedback	Optional
##Exam and feedback
By 5th of October each student should submit online to the teacher (instruction during the introduction day) the solutions of the problems. Student will pass the exam if they will answer correctly at least 70% of the problems and questions. The teacher will give the final results in two weeks. If the student is interested on 13th of October there will be a session where the teachers will give feedback to the students on the solutions of the problems.
